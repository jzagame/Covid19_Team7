                        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br><br> Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring
                        special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br><br> The best way to prevent
                        and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and
                        not touching your face.<br><br> The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette
                        (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). Stay informed:

                                                <p>Coronaviruses are often found in bats, cats and camels. The viruses live in but do not infect the animals. Sometimes these viruses then spread to different animal species. The viruses may change (mutate)
                                                    as they transfer to other species. Eventually, the virus can jump from animal species and begins to infect humans. In the case of COVID-19, the first people infected in Wuhan, China are thought to have
                                                    contracted the virus at a food market that sold meat, fish and live animals – but they are still investigating. Although researchers don’t know exactly how people were infected, they already have evidence
                                                    that the virus can be spread directly from person to person through close contact.</p>

                                        <p>COVID-19 enters your body through your mouth, nose or eyes (directly from the airborne droplets or from transfer of the virus from your hands to your face). The virus travels to the back of your nasal passages and
                                            mucous membrane in the back of your throat. It attaches to cells there, begins to multiply and moves into lung tissue. From there, the virus can spread to other body tissues.<br><br> Governments, health agencies,
                                            researchers and healthcare providers are all working together to develop policies and procedures to limit the spread of this virus both globally and from individual to individual.</p>

                                        <p>COVID-19 is likely spread:</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>When the virus travels in respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, sings or breathes near you (within six feet). This is thought to be the main way COVID-19 is spread.</li>
                                            <li>When the virus travels in small respiratory droplets that linger in the air for minutes to hours from an infected person who is more than six feet away or has since left the space. This method of spread is more
                                                likely to occur in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.</li>
                                            <li>From close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person.</li>
                                            <li>By touching surfaces that the virus has landed on, then touching your eyes, mouth, or nose before washing your hands. (Not thought to spread easily by this method.)</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h2 class="card-title h3 mb-3 text-left"><b>How long is a person infected with COVID-19 considered contagious?</b></h2>
                                        <p>Researchers are still learning about COVID-19. What IS known is that people infected with COVID-19 can spread the virus to others before experiencing symptoms themselves (while people are still “asymptomatic”).
                                            Once you do have symptoms, the CDC says you are no longer contagious 10 days after your symptoms began.<br></p>

                                        <p>Until everything about COVID-19 is fully understood, the best advice from healthcare providers to remain safe is to:</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Stay six feet away from others whenever possible.</li>
                                            <li>Wear a cloth mask that covers your mouth and nose when around others.</li>
                                            <li>Wash your hands often. If soap is not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
                                            <li>Avoid crowded indoor spaces. Bring in outdoor air as much as possible.</li>
                                            <li>Stay self-isolated at home if you are feeling ill with symptoms that could be COVID-19 or have a positive test for COVID-19.</li>
                                            <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says that "the immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood." Because this is a new strain of coronavirus, scientists are still collecting information and research on the
                                            virus so it's still too early to know if you can get it a second time if you've had it once.</p>
                                        <p>In a related theme, scientists are seeing a subset of patients who have COVID-19 and have symptoms that continue off and on for weeks and even months. These patients are called coronavirus long haulers. Scientists
                                            continue to follow these patients.</p>
