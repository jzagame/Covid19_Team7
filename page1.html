                                                <p>The German company BioNTech partnered with Pfizer to develop and test a coronavirus vaccine known as BNT162b2, the generic name tozinameran or the brand name Comirnaty. 
                                                    A clinical trial demonstrated that the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 95 percent in preventing Covid-19.</p>
                                                <p>The vaccine works by introducing a molecule to cells, known as messenger RNA (mRNA). This molecule teaches cells to make a protein from the virus that causes COVID-19, which is SARS-CoV-2.
                                                    The body detects this protein and triggers an immune response. This creates antibodies, as well as longer lasting immunity that can fight off future SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p>

                                        <p>When considering the impact of the Pfizer vaccine, it is important to distinguish between its efficacy and its effectiveness.</p>
                                        <p>“Efficacy” refers to the vaccine’s performance under ideal and controlled circumstances, such as in clinical trials. “Effectiveness” refers to its performance in real-world situations.</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Efficacy</li>
                                            <p>There is strong evidence from clinical trials that the Pfizer vaccine has a high level of efficacy. 
                                                A trial involving 43,548 participants, funded by BioNTech and Pfizer, reported that 2 doses of their vaccine confer 95% protection against COVID-19 in people aged 16 years and older.</p>
                                            <li>Effectiveness</li>
                                            <p>This result was consistent across age groups, sexes, races, ethnicities, and body weights, as well as those with underlying medical conditions and people who have already had a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
                                                A large study on the Pfizer vaccine involving about 1.2 million people in Israel supports the findings of clinical trials. It indicates that two doses of the vaccine reduce symptomatic cases of COVID-19 by 94% across all age groups after 7 days of receiving the second dose. 
                                                The vaccine also reduces severe illness by 92%.</p>
