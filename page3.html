                                                <p>Using mRNA as a medicine is a fundamentally different approach than treating disease with other drug classes.</p>
                                                <p>It plays a fundamental role in human biology. mRNA is the set of instructions by which cells make all proteins and send them to various parts of the body.</p>
                                                <p>mRNA medicines take advantage of normal biological processes to express proteins and create a desired therapeutic effect. This enables the potential treatment of a broad spectrum of diseases, many of which
                                                    cannot be addressed with current technologies.</p>
                                                <p>We believe mRNA has the potential to transform how medicines are discovered, developed and manufactured – at a breadth, speed and scale not common in our industry.</p>

                                        <p>A large 2020 trial, involving 30,420 adult volunteers at various sites across the U.S., reports that the Moderna vaccine has a 94.1% efficacy rate against COVID-19, including against severe disease.</p>
                                        <p>The average age of participants was 51.4 years, with 24.8% aged 65 years or older. Just over half of the participants (52.7%) were male. The majority of participants were white (79.2%), with racial and ethnic demographics
                                            generally representative of U.S. demographics (10.2% Black or African American and 20.5% Hispanic or Latino).</p>

                                        <p>Another study, which has yet to undergo peer review, investigated the real world effectiveness of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. The researchers compared 31,069 vaccinated individuals (having received at least
                                            one dose of either vaccine) with 31,069 unvaccinated people.</p>
                                        <p>The findings suggest that getting both doses of either COVID-19 vaccine was 88.7% effective in preventing infection.</p>
                                        <p>Those who did get COVID-19 following vaccination had significantly lower 14-day hospital admission rates than unvaccinated people of a similar demographic.</p>

                                            <li>In clinical trials, reactogenicity symptoms (side effects that happen within 7 days of getting vaccinated) were common but were mostly mild to moderate.</li>
                                            <li>Side effects (such as fever, chills, tiredness, and headache) throughout the body were more common after the second dose of the vaccine.</li>
                                            <li>Most side effects were mild to moderate. However, a small number of people had severe side effects that affected their ability to do daily activities.</li>
                                            <li>CDC will continue to provide updates as we learn more about the safety of the Moderna vaccine in real-world conditions</li>
